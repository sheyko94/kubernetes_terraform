## What does this project do?

This project is putting together into once place all the hard skills I have obtained during the years. From backend to DevOps enginner, from Java to Terraform. Using AWS as cloud provider and Github Actions as CI/CD tool.

The project is as minimal as possible, but it is a good starting point for a more complex project. The quality is the highest possible, with the best practices in mind.

Following you can find an overview of the architecture of the project. To get to know more about the technical details, please refer to the technical documentation.
